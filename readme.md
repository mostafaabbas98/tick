# tick

A simple and extensible CLI time tracker built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink), a React renderer for the command line.

## Description

**tick** is a personal time-tracking tool designed to help people keep track of work sessions directly from the terminal.
It starts simple — allowing you to start, stop, and report tracked sessions — but can be expanded over time with new features such as task management, reports, and data persistence.

## Why build it

- I’ll actually use it every day to track my work.
- Few good-looking, feature-rich CLI time trackers exist.
- Ink makes it possible to build polished, interactive interfaces right in the terminal.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**
- **Ink (React for CLI)**
- **Commander** for command parsing
